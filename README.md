# SQLConsole
Powershell and SQL text based console to admin and trouble Microsoft SQL environments.

This is my idea of a text driven console in Powershell that uses the DbaTools to help administor and troubleshoot Microsoft SQL server.

Goals of the project:

1) Bring together Powershell and SQL code into one easy to use menu.
2) Make the menu easily expandable.
3) Don't introduce any menu items that can cause harm to the database(s) or environment.

NOTE: this is my first Github project, so go easy with the comments please (if anyone sees this that is.)
      Oh, and no badgers were harmed in the making of this.
